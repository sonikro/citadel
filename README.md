Open Source, Web-based league system designed for games such as Team Fortress 2.

## Goals

* Highly configurable league system
* Full automation for regular tasks (league management/setup, etc.)
* Fine grained permission system

## Dependencies

You will need for running:

* Ruby 2.5
* Bundler
* Postgres 9.5 (configured in `config/database.yml`)
* ImageMagick

You will also need for testing:

* A js runtime supported by [execjs](https://github.com/rails/execjs)

To configure secrets (ie. steam API key) for development, run `rails
credentials:edit`.

## Docker

To run Citadel with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the Rails application on `http://localhost:3000`. PostgreSQL runs in a separate container and is only accessible within the Docker network for security reasons—the web container communicates with it through the internal Docker network.

### Production Image

The production Docker image uses Puma as the application server. Puma's behavior and logging can be controlled through environment variables:

* `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` - The minimum and maximum number of threads in the thread pool (default: 5)
* `WEB_CONCURRENCY` - The number of Puma worker processes to fork in clustered mode (default: 2)
* `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL` - The log level for Rails logging (default: info). Valid values are: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`

By default, the application is only accessible on localhost (127.0.0.1). To expose the application to external network interfaces, remove the `127.0.0.1` binding from the port configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

If you're running Citadel in HTTP mode behind a reverse proxy that handles TLS, set `config.force_ssl = false` in `config/environments/production.rb`.

## Installing

Here are some specific install instructions for operating systems/distributions.

### Ubuntu

Use either [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install Ruby `2.3.3`.

Install postgres with:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql
```

Then install all native dependencies required to install this project's gems:

```bash
sudo apt install libpq-dev imagemagick
```

Then install this project's gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or alternatively, if you don't want any of the test/development dependencies:

```bash
bundle install --without test development
```

If you're planning on running the test suite, you will also need to install a js runtime. Install `nodejs` like this:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

## Tests

This project uses `rspec`, `rubocop`, `haml-lint` and `rails-best-practices` for
testing and linting.

To set up the database for testing, run: `rake parallel:setup`.

All of these can be run in one command with rake:

```bash
rake
# or
rake test
```
